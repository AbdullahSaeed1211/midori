Hi [Name],

I noticed you're the [Title] at [Company] - impressive work on [specific recent achievement/post].

Quick question: Are you happy with how your website converts visitors into customers?

I help [industry] companies like yours increase conversions by 40-60% through strategic redesigns. Just helped [similar company] go from 2% to 3.4% conversion rate (that's an extra $50k/month for them).

Would you be interested in a free 15-minute website audit? I'll show you exactly what's costing you conversions right now.

Best,

Hi [Name],

Saw your company [Company] is growing fast - congrats on [recent milestone]!

I'm reaching out because 73% of businesses lose potential customers due to poor website experience. Most don't realize their site is costing them 6-figures annually.

I specialize in fixing these "silent profit killers" for [industry] companies. Recently helped [Company] recover $200k in lost revenue just by optimizing their homepage.

Mind if I send you a quick video audit of your current site? Takes 2 minutes to watch, might save you thousands.

Cheers,

‚Ä¢ [Company A]: +89% lead generation
‚Ä¢ [Company B]: +156% online sales  
‚Ä¢ [Company C]: +67% demo requests

The common thread? All had websites that looked good but didn't convert.

Would you be open to a brief call to discuss what's working in [industry] right now?

## **Email Cold Outreach Templates**

### **Template 1: The Audit Offer**
**Subject: Quick question about [Company]'s website**

Hi [Name],

I was researching [industry] companies and came across [Company] - impressive growth story!

Quick question: Are you happy with how your website converts visitors into customers?

I ask because I just completed a study of 50+ [industry] websites and found that 78% are losing potential customers due to 3 common conversion killers:

1. Unclear value proposition (costs 23% of conversions)
2. Poor mobile experience (costs 31% of conversions)  
3. Weak call-to-action placement (costs 19% of conversions)

I'd be happy to do a free audit of [Company]'s site and show you exactly where these opportunities might exist for you.

Would a 15-minute call this week work?

Best regards,
[Your name]

Sound familiar?

I specialize in fixing this exact issue for [industry] companies. Recently helped [Company] go from 1.8% to 4.2% conversion rate - that's an extra $73k/month in revenue.

The fix? Three strategic changes that took 2 weeks to implement.
