## üõ†Ô∏è **EMAIL 3: DAY 5 (Implementation Tips)**
**Subject:** The 5-minute fix that doubled Sarah's conversions

**Body:**
```
Hi [NAME],

Hope you're making progress on those conversion improvements!

I get this question a lot: "Abdullah, what's the fastest way to see results?"

Here's a 5-minute fix that's worked for 90% of our clients:

**THE 5-MINUTE CONVERSION BOOST:**

1. Go to your homepage
2. Look at your main headline
3. Ask: "Does this tell visitors exactly what they'll GET?"
4. If not, change it to: "Get [SPECIFIC BENEFIT] in [TIMEFRAME]"
5. Test it for one week

That's it.

Sarah from [COMPANY] made this change and saw a 34% increase in sign-ups within 48 hours.

The key is being specific about the outcome, not just the process.

‚ùå Bad: "Professional Web Design Services"
‚úÖ Good: "Get a Website That Converts Visitors Into Customers"

See the difference?

If you want us to review your specific headline and suggest improvements, just reply to this email with your website URL.

Best,
Abdullah

P.S. This works because visitors make a decision about your site in 8 seconds. Make those seconds count.

## üìû **EMAIL 4: WEEK 2 (Consultation Offer)**
**Subject:** Ready to turn your website into a conversion machine?

**Body:**
```
Hi [NAME],

It's been a couple of weeks since your conversion audit.

Have you had a chance to implement any of the recommendations?

I know it can be overwhelming to know where to start (that's why 73% of website owners never make these crucial changes).

Here's what I'm thinking...

What if we hopped on a quick 15-minute call where I could:

‚úÖ Review your specific website
‚úÖ Identify your #1 conversion opportunity  
‚úÖ Give you a step-by-step action plan
‚úÖ Show you exactly how we'd implement it

No pitch, no pressure - just actionable insights you can use whether you work with us or not.

Sound helpful?

Book a time that works for you: [CALENDAR LINK]

Or if you have questions first, just reply to this email.

Best,
Abdullah & the Kiiro team

P.S. We only take on 3 new conversion projects per month, so if you're interested in having us handle this for you, sooner is better than later.
