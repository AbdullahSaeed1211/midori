#### **Template A: Industry Opinion**
```
🔥 UNPOPULAR OPINION: Most "award-winning" websites are conversion disasters

I just reviewed 20 websites that won design awards this year.

The results? Shocking.

❌ Average conversion rate: 0.8%
❌ Average bounce rate: 76%
❌ Average load time: 4.2 seconds
❌ Mobile usability score: 67/100

Compare that to our "boring" client websites:
✅ Average conversion rate: 3.4%
✅ Average bounce rate: 42%
✅ Average load time: 1.8 seconds
✅ Mobile usability score: 94/100

The problem? Design awards prioritize:
• Visual creativity over user experience
• Artistic expression over business results
• Complexity over simplicity
• Designer ego over customer needs

Don't get me wrong - beautiful design matters.

But beautiful design that doesn't convert is just expensive art.

Your website's job isn't to win awards.
It's to win customers.

Here's why:

🤖 AI TOOLS ARE GETTING SCARY GOOD:

• Basic website templates
• Stock photography selection

• Standard e-commerce builds

💡 WHAT WILL SURVIVE:
• Strategic thinking
• Complex problem solving
• Client relationship management
• Custom functionality development
• Conversion optimization expertise

🎯 THE AGENCIES THAT WILL THRIVE:
• Focus on strategy over execution
• Specialize in specific industries
• Offer measurable business results
• Combine AI tools with human insight

The future isn't about competing with AI.
It's about leveraging AI to deliver better results faster.

Are you preparing for this shift?
